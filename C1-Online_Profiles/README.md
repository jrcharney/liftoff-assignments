### Resume
<!-- You will need to upload a .PDF of your resume to this repo, or connect with your mentor on an alternate way of submitting your resume. -->
Due to the sensitive nature of resume content, a reduced content resume will be provided here in the near future.  If you are committed to know more about me or interested in hiring me for a position, please use the LinkedIn page or send an email to [jrcharney@gmail.com](mailto:jrcharney@gmail.com?subject=Launchcode%20hiring%20opportunity).  I would prefer to work for an employer in the St. Louis Area to avoid the cost of relocating especially if it is to a city where the cost of living is significantly higher.

> **NOTICE:** Due to the ongoing global crisis, interviews will need to be held virtually.  
>
> Secondly, **Remote or Work-From-Home (WFH) offers will be subject to inspection to avoid scams and unpaid wages.** (I've been down this "wage theft" road at least twice. So, if this paragraph seems "unprofession" or "jaded", tell it to my previous employers.)  Also, it's no fun finding out your employer employer reported your earning to the IRS but didn't give you any pay stubs or a W-2 form every quarter to tell the IRS that "yes I did get that money he told you about".
>
> Any labor contract that written will need an addendum that states the following:
>
> > Payment is to be made by 4:00 PM on the Friday at the end of the pay cycle under the following conditions:
> > 1. The assignment was completed.
> > 2. The employee is terminated under any circumstance (fired, quits, laid-off, furloughed, etc.) 
> > 3. The pay cycle (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly) has completed.
> > 4. The employer has decided to fold up the company and abscond. (You'd be surprised how some companies suddenly quit and lock out their employees and customers suddenly.)
> > 5. Any other extraordinary circumstances where the employer is unable to fulfill their obligations, including bankruptcy. (Imagine if I ran up a credit card, didn't pay the bill, and declared myself insolvent? No financial institution would trust me to borrow from them if I did that.)
> >
> > Failure to pay for labor completed as defined in the contract will be considered a breach of contract, and the employer will be subject to legal penalty as it is illegal to avoid paying employees for hours worked.
> > There will be ZERO TOLERANCE for unpaid wages.
> > 
> > The employer MUST also submit quarterly payment reports that the employee can report to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as required by the IRS. This is not a task that can be placed on the employee. Furthermore, if the employee doesn't get a pay stub (either printed as an electronic document (e.g. PDF)) or W-2 form from the employer so that the employee can report his earning to the IRS, this will also be a breach of contract.
> > There will be ZERO TOLERANCE for unreported wages. 
>
> I wouldn't need to write any of this if my own employment experience was more fulfilling and positive. Unfortunately, it in necessary since it has happened to me more than once.
>
> TL;DR: If you can't afford employees to work for you, why are you here?! I'm done working for bozos. **I don't work for employers who don't pay for work!**
