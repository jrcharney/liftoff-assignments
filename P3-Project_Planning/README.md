# Project Planning
For this assignment, you'll create some initial plans for your project.

## Submission Instructions

### Wireframes

Include at least 3 wireframes here, adding images or files to your repository as necessary. Format them as a bulleted/unordered list with links to the files.

<!-- TODO: Use PlantUML to make wireframes -->

> **Note:** [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/) is available for VSCode. [Get it](https://github.com/qjebbs/vscode-plantuml) in the extension store.
> PlantUML uses a wireframe syntax called [Salt](https://plantuml.com/salt) that is easy to use.
> [This guy](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1278703/UML-Made-Easy-with-PlantUML-VS-Code) does a fairly good job of explaining how to set it up. Although, I'm not sure why syntax highlight doesn't work for `*.uml` files.

> **NOTE:** These Wireframe will also re-appear in the project in some `assests` folder. Where exactly I will list later.

#### Wireframe 1: User Management

Basically, your standard user management setup. "But I've seen this before!" or "This doesn't look like a wireframe".

I can assure you that it is. This wireframe shows the sequence of which you will encounter these wireframes.

![User Management](assets/User%20Management.png)

The User Management Part will include
* The Index Page
  * If the user is logged out, they will see a Splash Page
  * If the User is logged in, they will see map and probably a local weather report.
* The Sign Up Form
* The Login
* Password Recovery
* Username Recovery
* User Profile Settings


#### Wireframe 2: Process and Settings

This diagram shows how the user settings and the notification process aligns with each other

![Process and Settings](assets/Process%20and%20Settings.png)

The Process and Settings part will include
* User Settings
* An RSS Reader
* Filters to determine which feeds to look form
* Notifications
* A Display Map

#### Wireframe 3: The Notification, The Map, and The Menu

[!The Notification, The Map, and The Menu](assets/NMM.png)

In this wireframe, we show a case in which a Tornado Warning is threatening the area.

* A notification will tell the user about it.
* If they click on the notification, it will take them to a map in LightniNG showing them the full warning and the warned area.
* The user has the option to alter the layers of the map to see other features that are available.

Some of the settings in the menu are not set in stone yet.

### Project Tracker

<!-- Include a link to your public Trello board. Be sure you have user stories added for at least your first 2-week sprint. -->

Follow the progress of development on [my Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/u6vgjNE5/lightning-liftoff-project).

### Project Repo Link

LightniNG's Github repo can be found [here](https://github.com/jrcharney/lightniNG) though, I am hoping I can deploy it at on my Github pages [here](https://jrcharney.github.io/lightniNG).
